The [cronR](https://github.com/bnosac/cronR) package provides a simple R interface to the cron scheduler.

In many cases your script depends on other files which you should reference with relative paths inside an Rstudio project 
with the `here::here()` function.

In such cases the cronR default method for adding jobs produces an error:
``` r
library(cronR)

cmd <- cron_rscript("/home/rstudio/my_folder/my_script.R")
cron_add(command = cmd, frequency = 'daily', at = '18:00', id = 'test')
```

```
here() starts at /home/rstudio
Error in file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding) : 
  cannot open the connection
Calls: source -> file
In addition: Warning message:
In file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding) :
  cannot open file '/home/rstudio/R/scraping_functions.R': No such file or directory
Execution halted
```

As we can see, cron executes the script in user's home folder and fails to find the dependent files.

We can inspect the command `cmd` created by the package:
``` r
cmd
```
```
[1] "/usr/lib/R/bin/Rscript '/home/rstudio/my_folder/my_script.R'  >> '/home/rstudio/my_folder/my_script.log' 2>&1"
```

The problem can be solved by modifying the command by adding an additional `cd` to your folproject der, followed by the rest:

``` r
cmd <- "cd '/home/rstudio/my_folder' && /usr/lib/R/bin/Rscript './my_script.R'  >> './my_script.log' 2>&1"
cron_add(command = cmd, frequency = 'daily', at = '18:00', id = 'test')
```
```
here() starts at /home/rstudio/my_folder
```
