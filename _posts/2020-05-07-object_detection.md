## Package image.darknet

Computer vision is becoming more and more accessible. One simple way to
try it out by yourself has been made possible by the R package
[`image.darknet`](https://github.com/bnosac/image/tree/master/image.darknet){:target="_blank"}
which provides an easy to use interface to image classification and
object detection based on
[darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet){:target="_blank"}.

A
[blogpost](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/object-detection-in-just-3-lines-of-r-code-using-tiny-yolo-b5a16e50e8a0){:target="_blank"}
by AbdulMajedRaja RS explains how you can use this package with a [Tiny
YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/){:target="_blank"} model for object detection on
images. It takes only three lines of R code to detect objects on a given
image. An example of model’s output is shown
below.

The package is a wrapper for running the C coded darknet engine. Object
detection is therefore performed locally without any external
dependencies on Tensorflow and Python.

## Capturing the Output (on Windows)

One drawback of this package is that it doesn’t (yet?) output the types
and numbers of the detected objects back to R for further analysis. The
latest package version that I’m using at the time of this writing is
version 0.1.0.

**Duncan Golicher** shows in his
[blogpost](https://rpubs.com/dgolicher/yolo){:target="_blank"} a nice trick you can use to
access the above-mentioned data. His code, however, was written on a
Unix-like OS and doesn’t work on Windows. Below is my modification of
Duncan’s code which solves this problem.

### Installing the Package

Because the package `image.darknet` is currently only available on
Github, you have to install it with the `devtools` package. In case you
don’t yet have `devtools` installed, you need to do this first.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
```

During the installation on Windows, you will prompted to also install
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/){:target="_blank"}. When
`devtools` is ready, you can install
`image.darknet`:

``` r
# devtools::install_github("bnosac/image", subdir = "image.darknet", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### Setting up and Running the Detection Model

We first load all the required libraries and then set up the Tiny YOLO
model as described in package documentation:

``` r
# Object detection on images on Windows.
# Adaptation of the original code by Duncan Golicher: https://rpubs.com/dgolicher/yolo

library(image.darknet)
library(Rcpp)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(here)


## define the detection model (YOLO) 
detect_model <- image_darknet_model(
  type = "detect",
  model = "tiny-yolo-voc.cfg",
  weights = system.file(package = "image.darknet", "models", "tiny-yolo-voc.weights"),
  labels = system.file(package = "image.darknet", "include", "darknet", "data", "voc.names")
)
```

The images that we are going to use in this example are located in
subfolder `img` in our working directory. We are going to save the
output images to the subfolder `pred`.

``` r
# folder with input images
path <- here("img")

# get all pngs and jpgs
images <- dir(path = path, pattern = "\\.png|\\.jpg|\\.jpeg")

# folder for output images with predictions
dir.create('pred')
```

We next define a function that we are going to apply to all the images.
Note that there is a detection `threshold` parameter inside this
function that you can change to filter out detections with class
probabilities below this threshold.

``` r
# function to be applied to images
detect_objects <- function(x) {
  
  filename <- paste(path, x, sep = "/")
  
  prediction <- image_darknet_detect(
    file = filename,
    object = detect_model,
    threshold = 0.19
  )

  file.rename("predictions.png", paste0("pred/", x))
  return(prediction)
}
```

By default, the function `image_darknet_detect` produces a new image
called `predictions.png` in the working directory showing the objects
found. We copy this image into the folder `pred` and rename it back to
the original. The output of function `image_darknet_detect` (variable
`prediction`) is, however, empty. The result is invisible. Duncan fixed
this inconvenience with a “minor hack”. The output of the C coded model
was redirected from stdout to a file that can be read back into R.

On Windows we have to define two cpp functions. The first one, `redir`,
redirects stdout to a file `capture.txt`. The second one, `resetredir`,
resets this redirection back to the console.

``` r
cppFunction('void redir(){FILE* F=freopen("capture.txt","w+",stdout);}')
cppFunction('void resetredir(){FILE* F=freopen("CON","w+",stdout);}')
```

We can now apply the detection function to our images:

``` r
redir(); 
d <- lapply(images, detect_objects)
resetredir();
```

Output images in the `pred` folder have now been created as well as the
file `capture.txt`. Let’s take a look at
    it.

``` r
writeLines(readLines('capture.txt'))
```

    ## C:/Users/tomaz/Desktop/object detection/img/dog.jpg: Predicted in 3.263000 seconds.
    ## Boxes: 845 of which 3 above the threshold.
    ## car: 76%
    ## bicycle: 24%
    ## dog: 79%
    ## C:/Users/tomaz/Desktop/object detection/img/test_image.jpg: Predicted in 3.274000 seconds.
    ## Boxes: 845 of which 3 above the threshold.
    ## car: 97%
    ## person: 37%
    ## bicycle: 49%

### Reformatting the Output

The following code takes this file and reformats it to the final
dataframe.

``` r
# Read in the output file
d <- data.frame(txt = unlist(readLines("capture.txt"))) 

## Take out all the lines that we don't need.
d <- d %>% 
  filter(!grepl("Boxes", txt)) %>% 
  filter(!grepl("pandoc", txt)) %>% 
  filter(!grepl("unnamed", txt))

## Find the lines that contain the file names. Make a logical vector called "isfile"
d$isfile <- grepl(path, d$txt)

## Take out the path and keep only the file names
d$txt <- gsub(paste0(path, '/'), "", d$txt)

## Make a column called file that contains either file names or NA
d$file <- ifelse(d$isfile, d$txt, NA)

## All the other lines of text refer to the objects detected
d$object <- ifelse(!d$isfile, d$txt, NA)

## Fill down
d <- tidyr::fill(d, "file")

## Take out NAs and select the last two columns
d <- na.omit(d)[, 3:4]

# Separate the text that is held in two parts
d <- d %>% separate(file, into = c("file", "time"), sep = ":")
d <- d %>% separate(object, into = c("object", "prob"), sep = ":")
d <- d %>% filter(!is.na(prob))

# Keep only the prediction time
d$time <- gsub("Predicted in (.+).$", "\\1", d$time)

# Convert probabilities to numbers
d$prob <- as.numeric(sub("%", "", d$prob)) / 100

# Optionally remove the file
# file.remove("capture.txt")
```

### Results

``` r
d %>% knitr::kable()
```
