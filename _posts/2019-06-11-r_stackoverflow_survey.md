## Introduction

Stackoverflow has recently released the anonymized results of their
[2019 annual developer
survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). Let’s take a look on
what R users are saying about their salaries. Note that the following results
could be biased because of unrepresentative and in some cases
small samples.

## Data Preparation

The
[dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QOmVDpd8hcVYqqUXDXf68UMDWQZP0wQV)
consists of survey answers from nearly 90,000 respondents. About 5,000
of them reported using R for “extensive development work over the past
year”.

We first import the data and keep only the respondents who use R as part
of their professional work.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(countrycode)

# data import -------------------------------------------------------------

data <- read_csv("data/survey_results_public.csv")

# data preparation -----------------------------------------------------------

data_r <- 
  data %>% 
  filter(grepl('^R$', LanguageWorkedWith) | grepl(';R$', LanguageWorkedWith) | 
           grepl(';R;', LanguageWorkedWith) | grepl('^R;', LanguageWorkedWith)) %>% 
  filter(MainBranch %in% c('I am a developer by profession', 
                           'I am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work')) %>% 
  filter(Employment %in% c('Employed full-time', 
                           'Employed part-time', 
                           'Independent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed')) %>% 
  filter(!grepl('Other Country', Country)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Country), !is.na(ConvertedComp), ConvertedComp > 0) 
```

The first filter used reduces the dataset from 88,883 respondents to
5,048. The second filter excludes students, hobby programmers and former
developers. This reduces the dataset to 4,047 respondents. The third
filter excludes unemployed and retired respondents and the dataset is
further reduced to 3,871 respondents. Finally, we exclude respondents
from an unknown country and respondents with unknown or zero salary
(variable `ConvertedComp`). The final dataset size is 3,034 rows
(respondents).

We need two additional helper tables. The first one will contain number
of R users and their median annual USD salary by country.

``` r
# number of respondents using R by country
country_n_r_users <- 
  data_r %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarise(n_r_users = n(), median_convertedcomp = round(median(ConvertedComp)))
  
country_n_r_users %>% arrange(desc(n_r_users))
```

    ## # A tibble: 109 x 3
    ##    Country        n_r_users median_convertedcomp
    ##    <chr>              <int>                <dbl>
    ##  1 United States       1100               110000
    ##  2 Germany              197                61872
    ##  3 United Kingdom       190                68695
    ##  4 India                149                10920
    ##  5 Canada               105                64888
    ##  6 Netherlands           85                54996
    ##  7 France                81                41247
    ##  8 Brazil                80                16062
    ##  9 Australia             79                78332
    ## 10 Spain                 64                32254
    ## # ... with 99 more rows

The second table will contain country-continent information. We can use
the handy `countrycode::countrycode` function for this task:

``` r
# country - continent table
countries <- 
  data %>% 
  filter(!grepl('Other Country', Country)) %>% 
  distinct(Country) %>% 
  mutate(continent = countrycode(sourcevar = Country, origin = "country.name", destination = "continent"))

countries
```

    ## # A tibble: 179 x 2
    ##    Country                continent
    ##    <chr>                  <chr>    
    ##  1 United Kingdom         Europe   
    ##  2 Bosnia and Herzegovina Europe   
    ##  3 Thailand               Asia     
    ##  4 United States          Americas 
    ##  5 Ukraine                Europe   
    ##  6 Canada                 Americas 
    ##  7 India                  Asia     
    ##  8 New Zealand            Oceania  
    ##  9 Antigua and Barbuda    Americas 
    ## 10 Germany                Europe   
    ## # ... with 169 more rows

## Salary Distributions by Country

Our variable of interest is called `ConvertedComp` and is defined as
“salary converted to annual USD salaries using the exchange rate on
2019-02-01, assuming 12 working months and 50 working weeks.”

Annual salary distributions are visualized below by
[boxplots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot). To avoid displaying
(too much) noise, we limit ourselves to countries with at least five
reported R
users.

``` r
# boxplot visualization ---------------------------------------------------

data_r %>% 
  left_join(countries, by = "Country") %>% 
  inner_join(country_n_r_users %>% filter(n_r_users >= 5), by = "Country") %>% 
  mutate(Country = reorder(Country, ConvertedComp, median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = ConvertedComp, fill = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.size = 0.5) +
  ylab('Annual USD salary') +
  coord_flip(ylim = c(0, 200000)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 200000, by = 20000), 
                     labels = function(x) format(x, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = '.', scientific = FALSE)
                     ) +
  ggtitle("Distributions of R Users' Salaries by Country") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Continent")
```

United States has the highest median annual salary at 110,000 USD,
followed by Israel and Norway. The lower part of the graph is populated
by Asian, South American and African countries.

## Salary Distributions for United States

Let’s have a quick look at R users’ salary distributions by some interesting
variables for country with the highest number of respondents (1,100).

### Age

``` r
# Age
data_r %>% 
  filter(Country == 'United States') %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Age)) %>% 
  filter(Age >= 20) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(floor(Age/10)), y = ConvertedComp)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 300000)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(as.factor(floor(Age/10)), ConvertedComp),
              position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),
              alpha = 0.6,
              size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 300000, by = 20000), 
                     labels = function(x) format(x, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = '.', scientific = FALSE)
                     ) +
  ylab('Annual USD salary') +
  xlab('Age bin (years)') +
  ggtitle("Distributions of R Users' Salaries by Age Bin for United States") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("2" = "20-29", "3" = "30-39",
                          "4" = "40-49", "5" = "50-59", "6" = "60-69"))
```

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/sal_age-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The median of the second age group is is about 40% higher than the
median of the first one. The median of the third age group is is about
17% higher than the median of the second one. The median of the fourth
age group is is about 6% higher than the median of the third one. Note
that a few respondents reported salaries very close to zero.

### Gender

Similarly, distributions by gender can be plotted:

``` r
# Gender
data_r %>% 
  filter(Country == 'United States') %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Gender)) %>% 
  mutate(Gender = if_else(Gender %in% c('Man', 'Woman'), Gender, 'Other')) %>% 
  mutate(Gender = reorder(Gender, ConvertedComp, median)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(Gender), y = ConvertedComp)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 300000)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(as.factor(Gender), ConvertedComp),
              position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),
              alpha = 0.6,
              size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 300000, by = 20000), 
                     labels = function(x) format(x, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = '.', scientific = FALSE)
                     ) +
  ylab('Annual USD salary') +
  xlab('Gender') +
  ggtitle("Distributions of R Users' Salaries by Gender for United States") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/sal_gender-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Men report to earn about 15% higher median salary than women.

### Education Level

Rare education categories are excluded here for better readability.

``` r
# EdLevel
data_r %>% 
  filter(Country == 'United States') %>% 
  filter(!is.na(EdLevel)) %>% 
  inner_join(
    data_r %>% 
      filter(Country == 'United States') %>% 
      filter(!is.na(EdLevel)) %>% 
      group_by(EdLevel) %>% 
      count() %>% 
      filter(n >= 20) %>% 
      select(EdLevel),
    by = 'EdLevel'
  ) %>% 
  mutate(EdLevel = reorder(EdLevel, ConvertedComp, median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = EdLevel, y = ConvertedComp)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(EdLevel, ConvertedComp),
              position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),
              alpha = 0.6,
              size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 300000, by = 20000), 
                     labels = function(x) format(x, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = '.', scientific = FALSE)) +
  coord_flip(ylim = c(0, 300000)) +
  ylab('Annual USD salary') +
  xlab('Education Level') +
  ggtitle("Distributions of R Users' Salaries by Education Level for United States") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/sal_edlevel-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Bachelor’s degree holders report earning about 15% more than respondents
without a degree (median difference). Master’s degree holders report
earning about 9% more than respondents with bachelor’s degree.
Ph.D. holders report earning about 18% more than respondents with master’s
degree.

### Undergraduate Major

R users come from a diverse set of undergraduate degrees. Again we
exclude rare majors.

``` r
# UndergradMajor
data_r %>% 
  filter(Country == 'United States') %>% 
  filter(!is.na(UndergradMajor)) %>% 
  inner_join(
    data_r %>% 
      filter(Country == 'United States') %>% 
      filter(!is.na(UndergradMajor)) %>% 
      group_by(UndergradMajor) %>% 
      count() %>% 
      filter(n >= 10) %>% 
      select(UndergradMajor),
    by = 'UndergradMajor'
  ) %>% 
  mutate(UndergradMajor = reorder(UndergradMajor, ConvertedComp, median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = UndergradMajor, y = ConvertedComp)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(UndergradMajor, ConvertedComp),
              position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),
              alpha = 0.6,
              size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 300000, by = 20000), 
                     labels = function(x) format(x, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = '.', scientific = FALSE)) +
  coord_flip(ylim = c(0, 300000)) +
  ylab('Annual USD salary') +
  xlab('Undergraduate Major') +
  ggtitle("Distributions of R Users' Salaries by Undergraduate Major for US") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/sal_undergradmajor-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Interestingly, the highest median salary is reported by “other”
engineering majors (civil, electrical, mechanical).

### Developer Type

Note that each survey respondent had an option to pick more than one
category here. Even though we removed students from the `MainBranch`
column at the beginning of the analysis, some developers still report
being a student in the `DevType` column.

``` r
# DevType
data_r %>% 
  filter(Country == 'United States') %>% 
  filter(!is.na(DevType)) %>%
  select(Respondent, ConvertedComp, DevType) %>% 
  mutate(DevType_ = str_split(DevType, ';')) %>%
  unnest() %>% 
  select(-DevType) %>% 
  mutate(DevType = reorder(DevType_, ConvertedComp, median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = DevType, y = ConvertedComp)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  coord_flip(ylim = c(0, 350000)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(DevType, ConvertedComp),
              position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0),
              alpha = 0.6,
              size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 350000, by = 20000), 
                     labels = function(x) format(x, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = '.', scientific = FALSE)) +
  ylab('Annual USD salary') +
  xlab('Developer Type') +
  ggtitle("Distributions of R Users' Salaries by Developer Type for United States") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))  
```

As expected, executives and managers earn the most and students earn the
least.

## Conclusion

I hope you found the above insights interesting. Feel free to experiment
with this data by yourself and share your findings.
